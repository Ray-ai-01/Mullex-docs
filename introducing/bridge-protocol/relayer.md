The coexistence of multiple chains is the current and future landscape of the blockchain world. Asset transfers between different chains have made cross-chain protocols a fundamental necessity for blockchain users. Currently, cross-chain transactions are primarily facilitated by cross-chain bridges, which establish a pathway between two blockchains. Based on message communication, these bridges enable the minting of a 1:1 pegged representation of the asset on the destination chain.



The cross chain of  Relay Chain  is realized by the cross-chain bridge listening to the origin chain and the target chain. Assets will not be locked in the cross-chain bridge during the cross-chain process. And thanks to the state synchronization mechanism used in the cross-chain process, the historical data of assets can be completely preserved. The detailed cross chain process is as follows:

Suppose the origin chain is chain A, the target chain is chain B, and the cross-chain Token is X.

* The dapp developer deploys the X contract on chain A and chain B respectively;
* The dapp developer needs to submit the names of the two chains, the contract addresses, and the  project name to  Relay Chain .  Relay Chain  sets the above information into the cross-chain system of chain A and chain B and provides the dapp developer with the cross-chain contract address;X
* The dapp user initiates a cross-chain request of X to the cross-chain contract of chain A, and authorizes Relay Chain to lock X in the cross-chain contract of chain A;
* The  Relay Chain  nodes detect the lock event;
* The node that detects the lock event initiates a cross-chain consensus and starts the consensus through TSS-LIB. The node conducts verification and TSS signature first, and then broadcasts to other  Relay Chain  nodes;
* Other nodes decide whether to confirm the cross-chain request based on the information they have detected, and if so, conduct TSS signature;
* If the number of TSS signatures exceeds the threshold, a consensus is reached;
* &#x20;Relay Chain  adds the consensus data into the cross-chain information chart;
* &#x20;Relay Chain  sends a consensus-successful cross-chain request to chain B;
* The NFT contract on chain B verifies the validity and legitimacy of the TSS group signature;
* Upon a successful verification, chain B transfers X from the cross-chain contract to the dapp user, and the cross-chain process is completed.
